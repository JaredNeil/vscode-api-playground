# API Playground

This repo comprises several subdirectories, each of which is a self-contained extension that demonstrates a particular API, repros a bug, answers a stackoverflow question, etc.

You can find all of the vsix files to install the extensions yourself in each sub directory.

## Extensions:
* [HelloWorld](HelloWorld/README.md): The default extension generated by the vscode yeoman generator
* [FocusActiveEditor](FocusActiveEditor/README.md): An extension that will collapse directories and focus the active editor when switching between editors. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42673828/how-to-collapse-explorer-folders-before-focusing-a-file-in-vcode)
* [NewFileWithLanguageMode](NewFileWithLanguageMode/README.md): An extension that provides a command to open a new file with configurable language mode. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42677180/is-there-a-way-to-make-visual-code-create-html-file-by-default)
* [SymbolIcons](SymbolIcons/README.md): An extension that shows a list of all symbol types in vscode to demonstrate their icons. [Github](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/21315)
