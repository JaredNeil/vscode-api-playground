# API Playground

This repo comprises several subdirectories, each of which is a self-contained extension that demonstrates a particular API, repros a bug, answers a stackoverflow question, etc.

Each directory also contains a .vsix file that you can use to install the extension and try it out for yourself.

## Extensions:
* [HelloWorld](HelloWorld/README.md): The default extension generated by the vscode yeoman generator
* [NewFileWithLanguageMode](NewFileWithLanguageMode/README.md): An extension that provides commands to open new files with the language mode set. It allows opening files with the same language mode as the current file, or configuring a list of language modes that can be mapped to keyboard shortcuts.
