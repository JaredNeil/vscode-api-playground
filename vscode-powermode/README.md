# vscode-powermode README

This is an extension based on the [Code in the Dark editor's](http://codeinthedark.com/editor/) "Power Mode" and similar extensions from [this list](https://github.com/codeinthedark/awesome-power-mode),

It is currently a work in progress and only supports bad explosions and a shaky screen.

Up next:
* A combo meter in the status bar
* Powermode will activate after achieving a certain combo
* Configuration for:
   - The combo timeout
   - The powermode threshold
* More?
